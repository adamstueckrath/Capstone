<p>Assets Turnover = Total Sales Revenue / Average Total Assets</p>
Asset turnover is a ratio to help investors understand how successfully the company
          is utilizing each dollar's worth of its assets to generate revenue.
          A higher ratio normally represents a better performance of the company.
         However, whether the ratio is good or bad to a large extent depends on
          what industry the company operates in.
          <br /><br /><br />

<p>Price/Earnings Ratio = Market Value per Share / Earnings per Share</p>
P/E Ratio evaluates a company's current stock price compared to its earnings per share. 
          When comparing companies in the same industry, a higher P/E Ratio
           represents higher earnings growth.
